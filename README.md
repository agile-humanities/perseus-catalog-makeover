The Perseus Catalog has been developed over N years. (NOTES about history of the Catalog).

In that time there have been several models for the catalog's data...

The Perseus Catalog now serves two purposes:

  * It provides readers with an easy way to find editions of classical texts on the Internet;
  * It acts as a bibliographic knowledge base for applications.

In this project we endeavor to do three things:

  * Correct, simplify, and unify bibliographic records;
  * Create a simple web application to support basic searching and browsing;
  * Create a FRBRoo-based knowledge base.
  
In a second phase we plan to develop an API to the knowledge base.
